# Purpose
To process the street addresses listed in select editions of the mid-20th Century [Negro Motorist Green Book](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Negro_Motorist_Green_Book) through a contemporary geocoding service such as that from the US Census Bureau to see which addresses still return a result.  Show results on an interactive map.
